#Strong Arms

This is a very hacky attempt at preventing humans from having to draw Armstrong
relation tables by hand like some Neanderthals.

The relational schema and functional dependencies are to be placed in a file on
the same directory level called *dependencies.txt*.

The syntax can be derrived from the following example definitions:
 * Schema: *R = (A, B, C)*
 * Dependencies: *F = {A->B, A->C}*

 This seems to work correctly with the example provided in the exercise 4c from
 the week 4b coursework. It is completely possible that this is broken and
 doesn't work at all.
